&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the README part of this dimension. Unlike other dimensions though, this one you can come and go freely in. You don't NEED to be here, nor do you HAVE to be here...wait that is the same thing as need...oh well, moving on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from what I know, a README is what people use as a type of guide or manual for things such as downloaded game files or any downloaded file basically. There are some that don't have README's, but from my experience, they're usually poorly built files. Sadly, the README that you are reading right now is basically useless right now, unused and unneeded...so yeeeeaaaaah...sorry 'bout that, hope this will make do!
